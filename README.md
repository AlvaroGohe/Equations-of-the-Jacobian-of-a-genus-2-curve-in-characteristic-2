# Kummer surfaces and Jacobians of genus two curves in characteristic two

This repositary aims to complement the article Explicit desingularisation of Kummer surfaces in characteristic two via specialisation. It includes code for two programming languages: Mathematica, where all of the heavy computations have been performed, such as computing the equations of the Jacobian; and MAGMA, which has the arithmetic geometry functionalities that allow the equations that have been computed to be used for practical calculations. 

In order to execute the Mathematica code, it is necessary to use the package <a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/LinearAlgebraMod/' >LinearAlgebraMod</a> from the Wolfram function repository. This was contributed to Daniel Lichtblau, who I thank. For the Magma code, I used fragments of the code developed to compute models of quartic Kummer surfaces by Steffen MÃ¼ller, who I also thank.

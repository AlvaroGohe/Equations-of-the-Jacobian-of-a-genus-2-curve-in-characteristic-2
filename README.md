# Equations of the Jacobian of a genus 2 curve in characteristic 2
... and other topics related to theory of Kummer surfaces over fields of characteristic 2.
This repositary aims to complement the soon-to-be released article about this topic. It includes code for 2 programming languages: Mathematica, where all of the heavy computations have been performed, such as computing the equations of the Jacobian; and MAGMA, which has the arithmetic geometry functionalities that allow the equations that have been computed to be used for practical calculations.

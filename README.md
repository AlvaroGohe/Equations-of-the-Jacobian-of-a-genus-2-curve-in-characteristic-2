# Kummer surface and Jacobian of a genus two curve in characteristic two

This repositary aims to complement the article Explicit desingularisation of Kummer surfaces in characteristic two via specialisation. It includes code for two programming languages: Mathematica, where all of the heavy computations have been performed, such as computing the equations of the Jacobian; and MAGMA, which has the arithmetic geometry functionalities that allow the equations that have been computed to be used for practical calculations.
